# DSC180A_A08_Checkpoint1

This repository contains the basic codes for this project that focuses on multiple testing. The src folder contains the main R scripts, with all the functions inside, and the data folder, where all the datasets are held. 

In the reference folder, it contains the two papers written by Prof.Schwartzman, which are also the ones we will replicate. 

The function will return the t statistic, p values and various plots that show the differences between the theoretical null model and the empirical null model.

To run the functions.R file, please use the run-data.R .
